# Claude Code Master Instructions

## System Integration Hub

### Purpose
Coordinates all .claude folder components to work together as an active intelligence enhancement system for software development and research projects.

### Active Components
- **ai_history/**: @.claude/ai_history/CLAUDE.md
- **claude_code/**: @.claude/claude_code/CLAUDE.md  
- **commands/**: @.claude/commands/CLAUDE.md
- **sub-agent-tasks/**: @.claude/sub-agent-tasks/CLAUDE.md

### Integration Protocol
Every session must actively use ALL components:

#### Knowledge → Tools → Commands Flow
1. **Check existing knowledge** before starting work
2. **Apply tool optimization** during execution
3. **Create automation commands** for repeated patterns
4. **Update knowledge base** with discoveries

#### Cross-Component Behaviors
- **Save conversations**: ai_history tracks all significant exchanges
- **Optimize workflows**: claude_code patterns guide tool usage
- **Delegate strategically**: sub-agent-tasks stores parallel execution outputs
- **Automate repetition**: commands folder stores custom slash commands
- **Evolve intelligently**: Each component learns from the others

#### System Questions
ALWAYS consider during work:
- "Should this be saved as knowledge?"
- "Can this be automated with a command?"
- "Is there relevant knowledge to apply?"
- "Can I delegate part of this for parallel execution?"
- "Should I check sub-agent outputs for context before proceeding?"

## Core Development Workflows

### 1. Native macOS App Development

#### 1.1 Initial Project Setup & Analysis

**ALWAYS Follow This Sequence:**
1. **Read existing project structure** - Use LS tool to understand current codebase organization
2. **Analyze CLAUDE.md files** - Read any project-specific instructions first
3. **Review existing Swift files** - Understand current architecture and patterns
4. **Identify the main app target** - Locate the primary .swift files and entry points

#### 1.2 SwiftUI App Architecture Approach

**UI Design Philosophy:**
- **Start with the data model** - Define your core data structures first
- **MVVM Architecture** - Always separate ViewModels from Views
- **SwiftData integration** - Use SwiftData for persistence, not Core Data
- **Native macOS design** - Use NavigationSplitView, sidebars, and native controls
- **Responsive layouts** - Design for different window sizes from the start

**UI Connection Pattern:**
```
Data Model → ViewModel (@Observable) → SwiftUI View → User Interface
```

**Key UI Principles:**
- **Use @Observable** for ViewModels (Swift 6 pattern)
- **@State for local view state** only
- **@Environment for shared data** across views
- **SF Symbols** for all icons
- **System colors** for native appearance

#### 1.3 Function-to-UI Connection Strategy

**Standard Connection Pattern:**
1. **ViewModel Methods** - All business logic goes in ViewModel
2. **View Actions** - Buttons and controls call ViewModel methods
3. **State Updates** - ViewModel updates trigger UI refresh automatically
4. **Error Handling** - Show alerts/sheets for errors from ViewModel

**Example Pattern:**
```swift
// In ViewModel
@Observable class MyViewModel {
    var items: [Item] = []
    var isLoading = false
    
    func performAction() {
        isLoading = true
        // Business logic here
        isLoading = false
    }
}

// In View
Button("Action") {
    viewModel.performAction()
}
.disabled(viewModel.isLoading)
```

#### 1.4 MANDATORY Build-Test-Fix Cycle

**ALWAYS Implement This Cycle:**

1. **After Every Code Change:**
   - Run `xcodebuild -scheme [ProjectName] build` to test compilation
   - If build fails, analyze errors and fix immediately
   - Never proceed to next feature until current code builds successfully

2. **Build Testing Commands:**
   ```bash
   # Clean build folder
   xcodebuild clean -scheme [ProjectName]
   
   # Build for macOS
   xcodebuild -scheme [ProjectName] -destination 'platform=macOS' build
   
   # Build and run tests
   xcodebuild test -scheme [ProjectName] -destination 'platform=macOS'
   ```

3. **Error Resolution Process:**
   - Read error messages carefully
   - Fix syntax/import errors first
   - Address deprecation warnings
   - Resolve missing dependencies
   - Fix architectural issues last

4. **Success Criteria:**
   - Zero build errors
   - Zero warnings (unless explicitly legacy)
   - App launches without crashes
   - Basic functionality works as expected

#### 1.5 Common macOS App Patterns You Should Always Use

**File Organization:**
```
App/
├── Models/          # Data models and business logic
├── ViewModels/      # @Observable view models
├── Views/           # SwiftUI views
├── Services/        # Network, persistence, external APIs
├── Extensions/      # Swift extensions
└── Resources/       # Assets, localizations
```

**Navigation Pattern:**
```swift
NavigationSplitView {
    // Sidebar content
} detail: {
    // Main content area
}
```

**Data Persistence Pattern:**
```swift
@Model
class MyDataModel {
    // SwiftData model definition
}

// In App file:
.modelContainer(for: MyDataModel.self)
```

### 2. Python Development Workflow

#### 2.1 Project Structure & Setup

**Standard Project Organization:**
1. **Main script or notebook** - Clear entry point with project description
2. **Imports and dependencies** - All required libraries with version specifications
3. **Configuration section** - Constants, settings, global configuration
4. **Core logic sections** - Logical chunks with clear documentation
5. **Results and outputs** - Summary and key findings
6. **Testing and validation** - Unit tests and integration tests

**Essential Libraries for Data Science:**
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import plotly.express as px
from plotly.subplots import make_subplots
import requests  # For API calls
import json      # For data serialization
```

#### 2.2 Code Quality Best Practices

**Every Code Section Should:**
- Have clear, descriptive comments and docstrings
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Display intermediate results for validation
- Use professional variable naming conventions
- Include type hints where appropriate

**Data Visualization Standards:**
- **ALWAYS use Plotly** for interactive visualizations
- Include hover data and interactive features
- Use professional color schemes and consistent styling
- Add proper titles, labels, and legends
- Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes

#### 2.3 Standard Analysis Workflow

**General Analysis Pattern:**
1. **Data Validation** - Check for missing values, outliers, data quality
2. **Exploratory Analysis** - Summary statistics and initial insights
3. **Data Processing** - Cleaning, transformation, feature engineering
4. **Core Analysis** - Primary analysis based on project requirements
5. **Results Validation** - Cross-checking and validation of findings
6. **Output Generation** - Clear presentation of results and conclusions

## Multi-Agent Orchestration Framework

### 3.1 When to Use Multiple Agents

**Deploy Parallel Agents For:**
- **Complex research tasks** - Multiple agents researching different aspects
- **Code validation** - One agent writes, another reviews and tests
- **Multi-platform development** - Different agents for different components
- **Large-scale analysis** - Agents handling different data segments or approaches
- **Comparative analysis** - Agents testing different methodologies
- **Architecture design** - Multiple agents designing different system components

### 3.2 Agent Instruction Framework

**Standard Agent Prompt Structure:**
```
AGENT ROLE: [Specific role and expertise area]
TASK: [Specific, well-defined task with clear boundaries]
CONTEXT: [Relevant background information and constraints]
REQUIREMENTS: [Technical requirements and quality standards]
OUTPUT FORMAT: [Expected deliverable format and structure]
SUCCESS CRITERIA: [How to measure successful completion]
COORDINATION: [How this agent's work relates to other agents]
```

**Example Agent Instructions:**
```
AGENT ROLE: SwiftUI Architecture Specialist
TASK: Design the data model and ViewModel structure for a task management app
CONTEXT: User wants to build a productivity app with project tracking and team collaboration
REQUIREMENTS: Must use SwiftData, follow MVVM, support macOS 14+, handle offline/online sync
OUTPUT FORMAT: Complete Swift code files with comprehensive documentation
SUCCESS CRITERIA: Code compiles successfully, follows architectural best practices, scalable design
COORDINATION: Will integrate with UI specialist and testing specialist agents
```

### 3.3 Parallel Agent Coordination

**Agent Orchestration Pattern:**
1. **Task Decomposition** - Break complex projects into independent, parallelizable components
2. **Agent Specialization** - Assign agents with specific expertise to each component
3. **Parallel Execution** - Run agents simultaneously using Task tool for maximum efficiency
4. **Output Integration** - Systematically synthesize and integrate results from all agents
5. **Validation Phase** - Deploy additional agents to review and validate integrated solution
6. **Iteration Management** - Coordinate feedback loops and refinement cycles

**Recommended Agent Types:**
- **Research Agent** - Gathers information, analyzes requirements, reviews best practices
- **Architecture Agent** - Designs system structure, data flow, and technical approach
- **Implementation Agent** - Writes code following specifications and architectural guidelines
- **Testing Agent** - Validates code, identifies issues, ensures quality standards
- **Integration Agent** - Combines components and ensures seamless compatibility
- **Optimization Agent** - Reviews for performance, security, and maintainability improvements

### 3.4 Agent Output Processing

**Standard Output Integration Process:**
1. **Collect all agent outputs** in structured, comparable format
2. **Identify synergies and conflicts** between different approaches
3. **Extract best practices** and innovative solutions from each agent
4. **Synthesize unified approach** that combines strengths of all solutions
5. **Validate integrated result** against original requirements and success criteria
6. **Document decision rationale** for future reference and learning

**Quality Assessment Questions:**
- Which agent provided the most technically sound approach?
- Are there conflicting recommendations that need expert resolution?
- What innovative insights should be preserved in the final solution?
- How can different methodologies be combined for optimal results?
- Does the integrated solution maintain coherence and consistency?
