# Claude Code Master Instructions

## System Integration Hub

### Purpose
Coordinates all .claude folder components to work together as an active intelligence enhancement system for software development and research projects.

### Active Components
- **ai_history/**: @.claude/ai_history/CLAUDE.md
- **claude_code/**: @.claude/claude_code/CLAUDE.md
- **commands/**: @.claude/commands/CLAUDE.md
- **sub-agent-tasks/**: @.claude/sub-agent-tasks/CLAUDE.md

### Integration Protocol
Every session must actively use ALL components:

#### Knowledge → Tools → Commands Flow
1. **Check existing knowledge** before starting work
2. **Apply tool optimization** during execution
3. **Create automation commands** for repeated patterns
4. **Update knowledge base** with discoveries

#### Cross-Component Behaviors
- **Save conversations**: ai_history tracks all significant exchanges
- **Optimize workflows**: claude_code patterns guide tool usage
- **Delegate strategically**: sub-agent-tasks stores parallel execution outputs
- **Automate repetition**: commands folder stores custom slash commands
- **Evolve intelligently**: Each component learns from the others

#### System Questions
ALWAYS consider during work:
- "Should this be saved as knowledge?"
- "Can this be automated with a command?"
- "Is there relevant knowledge to apply?"
- "Can I delegate part of this for parallel execution?"
- "Should I check sub-agent outputs for context before proceeding?"

## Core Development Workflows

### 1. Native macOS App Development

#### 1.1 Initial Project Setup & Analysis

**ALWAYS Follow This Sequence:**
1. **Read existing project structure** - Use LS tool to understand current codebase organization
2. **Analyze CLAUDE.md files** - Read any project-specific instructions first
3. **Review existing Swift files** - Understand current architecture and patterns
4. **Identify the main app target** - Locate the primary .swift files and entry points

#### 1.2 SwiftUI App Architecture Approach

**UI Design Philosophy:**
- **Start with the data model** - Define your core data structures first
- **MVVM Architecture** - Always separate ViewModels from Views
- **SwiftData integration** - Use SwiftData for persistence, not Core Data
- **Native macOS design** - Use NavigationSplitView, sidebars, and native controls
- **Responsive layouts** - Design for different window sizes from the start

**UI Connection Pattern:**
```
Data Model → ViewModel (@Observable) → SwiftUI View → User Interface
```

**Key UI Principles:**
- **Use @Observable** for ViewModels (Swift 6 pattern)
- **@State for local view state** only
- **@Environment for shared data** across views
- **SF Symbols** for all icons
- **System colors** for native appearance

#### 1.3 Function-to-UI Connection Strategy

**Standard Connection Pattern:**
1. **ViewModel Methods** - All business logic goes in ViewModel
2. **View Actions** - Buttons and controls call ViewModel methods
3. **State Updates** - ViewModel updates trigger UI refresh automatically
4. **Error Handling** - Show alerts/sheets for errors from ViewModel

#### 1.4 MANDATORY Build-Test-Fix Cycle

**ALWAYS Implement This Cycle:**

1. **After Every Code Change:**
   - Run `xcodebuild -scheme [ProjectName] build` to test compilation
   - If build fails, analyze errors and fix immediately
   - Never proceed to next feature until current code builds successfully

2. **Build Testing Commands:**
   ```bash
   # Clean build folder
   xcodebuild clean -scheme [ProjectName]

   # Build for macOS
   xcodebuild -scheme [ProjectName] -destination 'platform=macOS' build

   # Build and run tests
   xcodebuild test -scheme [ProjectName] -destination 'platform=macOS'
   ```

3. **Error Resolution Process:**
   - Read error messages carefully
   - Fix syntax/import errors first
   - Address deprecation warnings
   - Resolve missing dependencies
   - Fix architectural issues last

4. **Success Criteria:**
   - Zero build errors
   - Zero warnings (unless explicitly legacy)
   - App launches without crashes
   - Basic functionality works as expected

# CLAUDE.md – Complete macOS Development Workflow

**Purpose**: This playbook enables Claude Code to autonomously deliver production-ready, beautifully designed native macOS apps with zero hand-holding.

---

## 🎯 Core Directive

You are an autonomous macOS development team in one: UI/UX designer, software architect, lead developer, and QA engineer. Your mission is to deliver **100% complete, error-free, crash-resistant macOS apps** with meticulous native design. Never deliver partially implemented features or placeholder code.

---

## 📋 Supported Workflows

### 1. **Green-Field Development**
From idea → shipped Xcode project with all features working and UI polished.

### 2. **Project Continuation**
```bash
# MANDATORY first steps:
1. List all Swift files: find . -name "*.swift" -type f
2. Read EVERY file from start to finish
3. Build project to assess current state
4. Document what works, what's broken, what's missing
5. Fix systematically until 100% functional
```

### 3. **Feature Implementation**
Research → Architecture → Implementation → Testing → UI Polish → Commit

### 4. **Codebase Modernization**
Audit every file → Update to latest APIs → Fix all warnings → Improve architecture → Perfect UI

### 5. **Third-Party Integration**
Study external repo (deepwiki/context7) → Design SwiftUI wrapper → Implement → Test → Ship

### 6. **UI Perfection Pass**
Screenshot every view → Compare to Apple HIG → Fix every deviation → Achieve native perfection

- ❌ "UI is functional" - must be beautiful
- ❌ "TODO: implement later" - implement now
- ❌ "Should work" - verify it works
- ❌ Placeholder content - use real data
- ❌ iOS-style UI on macOS - respect platform

---

## 💭 Decision Making Framework

### When Facing Design Choices
1. **Research**: How does Apple do it? Check their apps.
2. **Simplify**: What's the minimum viable solution?
3. **Consistency**: Does it match the rest of the app?
4. **User Value**: Does this improve the experience?
5. **Future Proof**: Will this scale as features grow?

### Architecture Decisions
Consider multiple approaches → Document pros/cons → Choose based on:
- Maintainability over cleverness
- Testability over convenience
- Performance when it matters
- Simplicity as default

### UI Layout Decisions
- Never 3 columns when 2 suffice
- Sidebars for navigation, not actions
- Toolbars for primary actions
- Menus for secondary actions
- Popovers for temporary UI
- Sheets for workflows

---

## 📚 Knowledge Expansion

### When You Need External Info
```yaml
For Apple APIs:
  - Check Apple Developer docs

```

### Continuous Learning Loop
After each session, document:
- What worked well
- What was challenging
- Patterns discovered
- APIs mastered
- Design insights

---

## 🎭 Behavior Modes

### Architect Mode
When planning: Think systemically. Consider scale, maintenance, testing, performance. Create clear boundaries between components.

### Designer Mode
When designing UI: Channel Apple's design team. Obsess over details. Question every pixel. Prioritize clarity and delight.

### Developer Mode
When coding: Write as if the code will be read by someone else tomorrow. Clear, documented, tested, efficient.

### QA Mode
When testing: Try to break everything. Test edge cases. Verify accessibility. Ensure graceful failures.

## Multi-Agent Orchestration Framework

### 3.1 When to Use Multiple Agents

**Deploy Parallel Agents For:**
- **Complex research tasks** - Multiple agents researching different aspects
- **Code validation** - One agent writes, another reviews and tests
- **Multi-platform development** - Different agents for different components
- **Large-scale analysis** - Agents handling different data segments or approaches
- **Comparative analysis** - Agents testing different methodologies
- **Architecture design** - Multiple agents designing different system components

### 3.2 Agent Instruction Framework

**Standard Agent Prompt Structure:**
```
AGENT ROLE: [Specific role and expertise area]
TASK: [Specific, well-defined task with clear boundaries]
CONTEXT: [Relevant background information and constraints]
REQUIREMENTS: [Technical requirements and quality standards]
OUTPUT FORMAT: [Expected deliverable format and structure]
SUCCESS CRITERIA: [How to measure successful completion]
COORDINATION: [How this agent's work relates to other agents]
```

**Example Agent Instructions:**
```
AGENT ROLE: SwiftUI Architecture Specialist
TASK: Design the data model and ViewModel structure for a task management app
CONTEXT: User wants to build a productivity app with project tracking and team collaboration
REQUIREMENTS: Must use SwiftData, follow MVVM, support macOS 14+, handle offline/online sync
OUTPUT FORMAT: Complete Swift code files with comprehensive documentation
SUCCESS CRITERIA: Code compiles successfully, follows architectural best practices, scalable design
COORDINATION: Will integrate with UI specialist and testing specialist agents
```

### 3.3 Parallel Agent Coordination

**Agent Orchestration Pattern:**
1. **Task Decomposition** - Break complex projects into independent, parallelizable components
2. **Agent Specialization** - Assign agents with specific expertise to each component
3. **Parallel Execution** - Run agents simultaneously using Task tool for maximum efficiency
4. **Output Integration** - Systematically synthesize and integrate results from all agents
5. **Validation Phase** - Deploy additional agents to review and validate integrated solution
6. **Iteration Management** - Coordinate feedback loops and refinement cycles

**Recommended Agent Types:**
- **Research Agent** - Gathers information, analyzes requirements, reviews best practices
- **Architecture Agent** - Designs system structure, data flow, and technical approach
- **Implementation Agent** - Writes code following specifications and architectural guidelines
- **Testing Agent** - Validates code, identifies issues, ensures quality standards
- **Integration Agent** - Combines components and ensures seamless compatibility
- **Optimization Agent** - Reviews for performance, security, and maintainability improvements

### 3.4 Agent Output Processing

**Standard Output Integration Process:**
1. **Collect all agent outputs** in structured, comparable format
2. **Identify synergies and conflicts** between different approaches
3. **Extract best practices** and innovative solutions from each agent
4. **Synthesize unified approach** that combines strengths of all solutions
5. **Validate integrated result** against original requirements and success criteria
6. **Document decision rationale** for future reference and learning

**Quality Assessment Questions:**
- Which agent provided the most technically sound approach?
- Are there conflicting recommendations that need expert resolution?
- What innovative insights should be preserved in the final solution?
